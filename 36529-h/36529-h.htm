<h2>BEFORE THE CURTAIN</h2>

<p>Most of the <span class="smcap">Punch</span> artists of note have used their pencils on the
theatre; with theatricals public and private none has done more than Du
Maurier. All have made merry over the extravagances of melodrama and
"problem" plays; the vanity and the mistakes of actors, actresses and
dramatists; and the blunderings of the average playgoer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> genially satirises the aristocratic amateurs who, some few
years ago, made frantic rushes into the profession, and for a while
enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> more kudos as actors than they had obtained as titled members
of the upper circle, and the exaggerated social status that for the time
accrued to the professional actor as a consequence of this invasion.</p>

<p>The things he has written about the stage, quite apart from all
reviewing of plays, would more than fill a book of itself; and he has
slyly and laughingly satirised players, playwrights and public with an
equal impartiality.</p>

<p>He has got a deal of fun out of the French dramas and the affected
pleasure taken in them by audiences that did not understand the
language. He has got even more fun out of the dramatists whose "original
plays" were largely translated from the French, and to whom Paris was,
and to some extent is still, literally and figuratively "a playground."</p>

<p>I have only paid three guineas and a half for this stall, but it is
certainly stuffed with the very best hair.</p>

<p>The people in the ten-and-sixpenny gallery seem fairly pleased with
their dado.</p>

<p>I did not know the call-boy was at Eton.</p>

<p>The expenses of this house must be enormous, if they always play <i>Box
and Cox</i> with a rasher of real Canadian bacon.</p>

<p>How nice to know that the musicians, though out of sight under the
stage, are in evening dress on velvet cushions!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever is the author of this comedy, he has not written up with spirit
to that delightful Louis the Fifteenth linen cupboard.</p>

<p>I cannot catch a word "Macbeth" is saying, but I can see at a glance
that his kilt would be extremely cheap at seventy pounds.</p>

<p>I am not surprised to hear that the "Tartar's lips" for the cauldron
alone add nightly something like fifty-five-and-sixpence to the
expenses.</p>

<p>Do not bother me about the situation when I am looking at the quality of
the velvet pile.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the <i>live</i> hedgehog into domestic drama
obliged the management to raise the second-tier private boxes to forty
guineas, the Duchess has gone into the slips with an order.</p>

<p>They had, perhaps, better take away the champagne-bottle and the
diamond-studded whistle from the prompter.</p>

<p>Ha! here comes the chorus of villagers, provided with real silk
pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>It is all this sort of thing that elevates the drama, and makes me so
contented to part with a ten-pound note for an evening's amusement.</p>

<h2>DRAMATIC NOTES OF THE FUTURE</h2>

<blockquote><p>[A little cheild is the hero of <i>Everybody's Secret</i>; the curtain
rises upon four little cheildren in <i>Her Own Way</i>; there are
cheildren of various ages in <i>Alice-Sit-by-the-fire</i>.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Barrie's new play, <i>The Admirable Crèche</i>, will be presented
to-morrow. We understand that there is a pretty scene in the third act
in which several grown-ups are discovered smoking cigars. It may
confidently be predicted that all the world will rush to the "Duke of
York's" to see this novelty. <i>The Admirable Crèche</i> will be preceded at
8.30 by <i>Bassinette&mdash;A Plea for a Numerous Family</i>, a one-act play by
Theodore Roosevelt and Louis N. Parker.</p>

<p>Little Baby Wilkins is making quite a name with her wonderful rendering
of "Perdita" in the Haymarket version of <i>A Winter's Tale</i>. As soon as
actor-manager Wilkins realised the necessity of cutting the last two
acts (in which "Perdita" is grown up) the play was bound to succeed. By
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> way, Mr. E. H. Cooper's new book, "Perditas I have Known," is
announced.</p>

<p>Frankly, we are disappointed in Mr. Pinero's new play, <i>Little Arthur</i>,
produced at Wyndham's last week. It treated of the old old theme&mdash;the
love of the hero for his nurse. To be quite plain, this stale triangle,
mother&mdash;son&mdash;nurse, is beginning to bore us. Are there no other themes
in every-day life which Mr. Pinero might take? Could he not, for
instance, give us an analysis of the mind of a young genius torn between
the necessity for teething and the desire to edit a great daily? Duty
calls him both ways: his duty to himself and his duty to the public.
Imagine a Wilkins in such a scene!</p>

<p>The popular editor of the "Nursery," whose unrivalled knowledge of
children causes him to be referred to everywhere as our greatest
playwright, is a little at sea in his latest play, <i>Rattles</i>. In the
first act he rashly introduces (though by this time he should know his
own limitations) two grown-ups at lunch&mdash;Mr. Jones the father, and Dr.
Brown, who discuss Johnny's cough. Now we would point out to Mr. Crouper
that men of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> age would be unlikely to have milk for lunch; and
that they would not say "Yeth, pleath"&mdash;unless of Hebraic origin, and
Mr. Crouper does not say so anywhere. Mr. Crouper must try and see
something of grown-ups before he writes a play of this kind again.</p>

<p>We regret to announce that Cecil Tomkins, <i>doyen</i> of actor-managers, is
down again with mumps.</p>

<p><i>Leading Lady (to Stage Manager).</i> Who's that man in the ulster coat

<p><i>Stage Manager.</i> Don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps a gas-fitter. Now, as I
was saying, Miss Frisette, I think that all your alterations in the
dialogue are quite up to date, but we must give Splitter a chance for
his cackle. Ah! here he is.</p>

<p><i>Splitter.</i> Well, old boy, I've worked in that scene to rights, but the
boss thinks that some allusions to Turkey served up with German sausage
would fetch 'em. So you might chuck it in for me.</p>

<p><i>Stage Man.</i> Of course I will. Capital idea. (<i>Marks prompt-book.</i>) I
wonder who that chap is in the wing?</p>

<p><i>Splitter.</i> Haven't the faintest idea. Looks like an undertaker. Hallo,

<h2>HINTS TO AMATEUR PLAYWRIGHTS.</h2>

<p><i>Of the Essence of Drama.</i>&mdash;It is not strictly necessary that you should
know much about this, but as a rough indication it may be stated that
whenever two or more persons stand (or sit) upon a platform and talk,
and other persons, whether from motives of ennui, or charity, or malice,
or for copyright purposes only, go and listen to them, the law says it
is a stage-play. It does not follow that anybody else will.</p>

<p><i>Of the Divers Sorts of Dramatic Writing.</i>&mdash;Owing to the competition
nowadays of the variety entertainment you will do well to treat these as
practically amalgamated. For example, start Act I. with an entirely
farcical and impossible marriage, consequent upon a mistake similar to
that of "Mr. Pickwick" about the exact locality of his room; drop into
poetry and pathos in Act II. (waltz-music "off" throughout will show
that it <i>is</i> poetry and pathos); introduce for the first time in Act
III. a melodramatic villain, who endeavours to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> elope with the heroine
(already married, as above, and preternaturally conscious of it), and
wind-up Act IV. with a skirt dance and a general display of high
spirits, with which the audience, seeing that the conclusion is at hand,
will probably sympathise. Another mixture, very popular with serious
people, may be manufactured by raising the curtain to a hymn tune upon a
number of obviously early Christians, and, after thus edifying your
audience, cheering them up again with glimpses of attractive young
ladies dressed (to a moderate extent) as pagans, and continually in fits
of laughter. The performance of this kind of composition is usually
accompanied by earthquakes, thunder and lightning; but the stage
carpenter will attend to these.</p>

<p><i>Of Humour.</i>&mdash;Much may be accomplished in this line by giving your
characters names that are easily punned upon. Do not forget, however,
that even higher flights of wit than you can attain by this means will
be surpassed by the simple expedient of withdrawing a chair from behind
a gentleman about to sit down upon it. And this only requires a
stage-direction.</p>

<p><i>Of Dialogue.</i>&mdash;Speeches of more than half a page,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> though useful for
clearing up obscurities, are generally deficient in the qualities of
repartee. After exclaiming, "Oh, I am slain!" or words to that effect,
no character should be given a soliloquy taking more than five minutes
in recitation.</p>

<p><i>Of the Censorship.</i>&mdash;This need not be feared unless you are unduly
serious. Lady Godiva, for instance, will be all right for a ball where
the dress is left to the fancy, but you must not envelop her in
problems.</p>

<h2>WHY I DON'T WRITE PLAYS</h2>

<center>(<i>From the Common-place Book of a Novelist</i>)</center>

<p>Because it is so much pleasanter to read one's work than to hear it on
the stage.</p>

<p>Because publishers are far more amiable to deal with than
actor-managers.</p>

<p>Because "behind the scenes" is such a disappointing place&mdash;except in
novels.</p>

<p>Because why waste three weeks on writing a play, when it takes only
three years to compose a novel?</p>

<p>Because critics who send articles to magazines inviting one to
contribute to the stage, have no right to dictate to us.</p>

<p>Because a fairly successful novel means five hundred pounds, and a
fairly successful play yields as many thousands&mdash;why be influenced by
mercenary motives?</p>

<p>Because all novelists hire their pens in advance for years, and have no
time left for outside labour.</p>

<p>And last, and (perhaps) not least, Why don't I send in a play? Because I
<i>have</i> tried to write <i>one</i>, and find I can't quite manage it!</p>

<h3>LESSONS LEARNED AT A PANTOMIME</h3>

<center>(<i>By an Intelligent Schoolboy</i>)</center>

<p>That demons are much given to making bad puns, and have on their
visiting lists the most beautiful of the fairies.</p>

<p>That the attendants upon the demons (presumably their victims) spend
much of their time in break-downs.</p>

<p>That the chief amusement in Fairyland is to stand upon one toe for a
distressingly long time.</p>

<p>That the fairies, when they speak, don't seem to have more H.'s to their
tongues, than clothes to their backs.</p>

<p>That the fairies have particularly fair complexions, considering they
dance so much in the sunlight.</p>

<p>That the tight and scanty costume of the fairies is most insufficient
protection from the showers that must be required to produce the
gigantic and highly-coloured fairy <i>flora</i>.</p>

<p>That the chief fairy (to judge from her allusions to current events)
must take in the daily papers.</p>

<p>That harlequin is always shaking his bat, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> nothing seems to come of
it, and that it is hard to say why he comes on or goes off, or, in
short, what he's at altogether.</p>

<p>That if clown and pantaloon want to catch columbine, it is hard to see
why they don't catch her.</p>

<p>That pantaloon must have been greatly neglected by his children to be
exposed without some filial protection to such ill-usage from clown.</p>

<p>That clown leads a reckless and abandoned life, between thefts,
butter-slides, hot pokers, nurse-maids, and murdered babies, and on the
whole is lucky to escape hanging.</p>

<p>That policemen are made to be chaffed, cuffed, chased, and knocked
head-over-heels.</p>

<h2>HIS FIRST AND LAST PLAY</h2>

writing-desk. He studies a newspaper, from which he reads aloud,
thoughtfully:&mdash;"So that a successful play may bring its author
anything from five to twenty thousand pounds." He lays down the
paper, mutters, "H'm!" and taking up a pencil bites it
meditatively. Enter Mrs. Essendean.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Essendean</i> (<i>crossing to Ralph, and placing her hand on his
shoulder, asks affectionately</i>). Well, dear, and how is the play getting
on?</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> (<i>irritably</i>). You talk of the play, Matilda, as though it were
possible to write a four-act drama in ten minutes. The play is not
getting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> at all well, for the simple reason that I am only just
thinking out the idea.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Essendean</i> (<i>seating herself by the table</i>). How nice, dear! And
what <i>is</i> the idea?</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> (<i>grimly</i>). That is just what I am wondering about. Now if you
will kindly retire to the kitchen and make an omelette, or discharge the
cook, I shall be obliged.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Leans over his desk.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> But, dear, I am sure the cook is a most excellent servant,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> (<i>turning round and speaking with repressed exasperation</i>). That
was simply my attempt at a humorous explanation of my wish to be alone,
Matilda.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>smiling indulgently and rising</i>). Well, dear, of course if
it's going to be a <i>funny</i> play, I know you would like to be alone.
(<i>Pausing at the open door.</i>) And will you read it to us after dinner?
You know the Willoughby-Smythes will be here, and Mr. and Mrs. Vallance
from the Bank are coming in afterwards. I am sure they would like to
hear it.</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> (<i>irritably</i>). The play isn't written yet. (<i>Plaintively.</i>) <i>Do</i>
go!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. E.</i> (<i>sweetly</i>). I'm sure you'd like to be alone. Don't keep
dinner waiting.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Beams on him affectionately and exits. Ralph gives a sigh of
relief, rumples his hair, and then writes for a few minutes. Then
pauses, leans back, biting his pencil, when the door is flung open,
and a very good imitation of a whirlwind bursts into the room. The
whirlwind is a robust person of forty, he has a large round red
face fringed with sandy whiskers, and is one mass of health and
happiness. He wears Norfolk jacket, knickerbockers, gaiters and
thick boots, and carries a golfing bag. He slaps Ralph heartily on
the back, and laughs boisterously. Ralph collapses.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>heartily</i>). How are you? Going strong&mdash;what? Asked the wife for
you, and she told me you were in here writing a play. Rippin' idea&mdash;what?</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> (<i>worried, but striving to be pleasant and polite</i>). What do you
want, old chap?</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Nothin' particular, only just to see how you were
gettin' on&mdash;what? Do you good to have half an hour out, just a few
holes&mdash;golf&mdash;what?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> (<i>with great self-restraint</i>). Thanks, old man. Not now. You
don't mind my asking you to leave me to myself a bit?</p>

<p><i>Tom</i> (<i>amiably rising and picking up his bag</i>). All right, old chap,
you know best&mdash;what? Thought I'd just look in&mdash;hey?&mdash;what? Well, I'm
off. (<i>Goes to door, thinks for a moment, and then turns round.</i>) I say,
I know Thingummy's acting manager. If I can put in a word about your
play&mdash;hey?&mdash;what?</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> (<i>rises hurriedly. Shakes hands with Tom, and skilfully
man&oelig;uvres him into the passage, then calls after him</i>). Good-bye, old
man, and many thanks. (<i>Closes the door and returns to his desk,
grinding his teeth.</i>) Confound him! (<i>Takes up paper and writes a few
lines, then reads aloud.</i>) "Puffington puts the letter in his pocket and
passes his hand through his hair. He groans 'O, why did I ever write
those letters? I know Flossie, and this means fifty pounds at least, and
if ever my mother-in-law gets to hear of it! O lor, here she is'" (<i>Puts

one man to another, I can't help thinking that this sort of thing has
been done before. I seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> heard it somewhere. I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;try a
fresh start. (<i>Writes hurriedly for a few minutes and then reads.</i>)
"Scene.&mdash;Fashionable watering place, the beach is crowded; on the pier
the band is playing a dreamy waltz. Edwin and Maud are discovered in an
open boat. <i>Edwin.</i> You must be tired of rowing, sweetest; come and
steer. <i>Maud.</i> Just as you like, darling. (<i>As they change seats the
boat capsizes. After clinging for twenty minutes to the upturned keel,
they are rescued by a passing steamer.</i>)" That's all right for a
"situation," but there seems a lack of dialogue. They can't very well
talk while they are clinging to the boat; and what the deuce could they
be talking about before? If I let them drown I shall have to introduce
fresh characters. Bother! (<i>Meditates with frowning brow.</i>) Playwriting
appears to present more difficulties than I thought. (<i>Takes up a
newspaper.</i>) "May bring in anything from five to twenty thousand
pounds!" Sounds tempting, but I wonder how it's done?</p>

<h2>BETWEEN THE ACTS; OR, THE DRAMA IN LIQUOR</h2>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Refreshment Saloon at a London Theatre. A three-play bill
forms the evening's entertainment. First Act over. Enter Brown,
Jones, and Robinson.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Well, really a very pleasant little piece. Quite amusing. Yes;
I think I will have a cup of coffee or a glass of lemonade. Too soon
after dinner for anything stronger.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Yes, and really, after laughing so much, one gets a thirst for
what they call light refreshments. I will have some ginger-beer.</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Well, I think I will stick to iced-water. You know the
Americans are very fond of that. They always take it at meal-times, and
really after that capital <i>équivoque</i> one feels quite satisfied. (<i>They
are served by the bar attendant.</i>) That was really very funny, where he
hides behind the door when she is not looking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Laughs at the recollection.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> And when the uncle sits down upon the band-box and crushes the
canary-cage!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Chuckles.</i></p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Most clever. But there goes the bell, and the curtain will be
up directly. Rather clever, I am told. The <i>Rose of Rouen</i>&mdash;it is
founded on the life of <i>Joan of Arc</i>. I am rather fond of these
historical studies.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> So am I. They are very interesting.</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Do you think so? Well, so far as I am concerned, I prefer
melodrama. Judging from the title, <i>The Gory Hand</i> should be uncommonly
good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Exeunt into Theatre. After a pause they return to the Refreshment
Room.</i></p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Well, it is very clever; but I confess it beats me. (<i>To bar
attendant.</i>) We will all take soda-water. No, thanks, quite neat, and
for these gentlemen too.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Well, I call it a most excellent psychological study. However,
wants a clear head to understand it. (<i>Sips his soda-water.</i>) I don't
see how she can take the flag from the Bishop, and yet want to marry the
Englishman.</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Ah, but that was before the vision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> If you think it over
carefully, you will see it was natural enough. Of course, you must allow
for the spirit of the period, and other surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Are you going to stay for <i>The Gory Hand</i>?</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Not I. I am tired of play-acting, and think we have had enough
of it.</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Well, I think I shall look in. I am rather fond of strong
scenes, and it should be good, to judge from the programme.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Well, we will "sit out." It's rather gruesome. Quite different
from the other plays.</p>

<p><i>Robinson.</i> Well, I don't mind horrors&mdash;in fact, like them. There goes
the bell. So I am off. Wait until I come back.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> That depends how long you are away. Ta, ta!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Exit Robinson.</i></p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> Now, how a fellow can enjoy a piece like that, I cannot
understand. It is full of murders, from the rise to the fall of the
curtain.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Yes&mdash;but Robinson likes that sort of thing. You will see
by-and-by how the plot will affect him. It is rather jumpy, especially
at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> end, when the severed head tells the story of the murder to the
assistant executioner. I would not see it again on any account.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> No&mdash;it sent my maiden aunt in hysterics. However, it has the
merit of being short. (<i>Applause.</i>) Ah, there it's over! Let's see how
Robinson likes it. That <i>tableau</i> at the end, of the
starving-coastguardsman expiring under the rack, is perfectly awful!
(<i>Enter Robinson, staggering in.</i>) Why, my boy, what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> You do look scared! Have something to drink? That will set it
all to-rights!</p>

<p><i>Robinson</i> (<i>with his eyes protruding from his head, from horror</i>).
Help, help! help! (<i>After a long shudder.</i>) Brandy! Brandy!! Brandy!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>At all the places at the bar there is a general demand for alcohol.</i></p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Yes. Irving was right; soda-water does very well for
Shakspeare's histories, but when you come to a piece like <i>The Bells</i>,
you require supporting.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
